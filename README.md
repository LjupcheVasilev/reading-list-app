This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Testing

To run tests first run `npm install` then run the tests with `npm run test`

## Tradeoffs

- UI - did not spent too much time making the UI pretty
- Separation of concerns - With more time I would separate all DB operations into separate files and use that
- Tests - I would have liked to add more tests and possibly implement integration or e2e tests
- Separate components - With more time I would have separated the components properly so they can be re-used across the app
